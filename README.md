jquery.timepicker is a lightweight timepicker plugin for jQuery inspired by Google Calendar. It supports both mouse and keyboard navigation, and weighs in at 2.7kb minified and gzipped.

Requirements
------------
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (>= 1.7)

Introdution
------------
This is a branch of jquery.timepicker(http://jonthornton.github.com/jquery-timepicker).
I change some code, let it is use better in bootstrap.

1. Update css like bootstrap default theme.

2. Update 'appendTo' option default value. Let timepicker append after input/select on default.

3. Add class .ui-timepicker-hover. Selected style is keep style when list is on hover, and add a hover style when mouseover or key up/down.
